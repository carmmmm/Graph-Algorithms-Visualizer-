summary: "<div><div class=\"alert alert-primary\">You will practice concepts frequently\
  \ tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.</div>\r\n<p>Visualization\
  \ always draws attention. And it makes learning easier. What if we could visualize\
  \ everything? In this project, you will build a Java GUI application with Swing\
  \ to create graphs and visualize graph algorithms like traversals, spanning trees,\
  \ and shortest pathfindings.</p></div><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/207?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
